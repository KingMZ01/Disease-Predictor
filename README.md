# Disease-Predictor
🧠 Disease Predictor  

📌 Overview  
The **Disease Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict **Heart Disease** based on patient health data.  
The model is trained using classification algorithms and evaluated on healthcare datasets.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflows: **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction**.
