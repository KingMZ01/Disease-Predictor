#🧠 Disease Predictor  

📌 Overview  
The **Disease Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict **Heart Disease** based on patient health data.  
The model is trained using classification algorithms and evaluated on healthcare datasets.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflows: **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction**.

🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
- Training ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Model evaluation with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**  
- Visualizations: Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve  
- Predictions for new patient data (via input template CSV)
